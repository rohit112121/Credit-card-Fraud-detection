# Credit Card Fraud Detection 
I have built a Credit card Fraud Detection system using Machine Learning with Python. For this project, I have used the Logistic Regression model

Detecting fraud transactions is of great importance for any credit card company to detect potential frauds so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. So the goal is to build a classifier that tells if a transaction is a fraud or not.

The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

Due to confidentiality issues, the input variables are transformed into numerical using PCA transformations.

The dataset is taken from kaggle <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud' target='_blank'>here</a>.
